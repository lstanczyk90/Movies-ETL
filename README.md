# Movies ETL Project

## *_Project Summary_*

Using Python and Pandas, the purpose of this project was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. 

Specifically, a function was created within Python that reads the source data (CSV and JSON files), converts this data into DataFrames, cleans these DataFrames (by deleting unncessary information, filling in missing information, converting values to workable strings, dates, integers, etc., and ultimately to import merged datasets into Postgres.
